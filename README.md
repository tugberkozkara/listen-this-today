Listen this song today!

<br><br>
A simple web app to listen the song of the day, renewed every night at 12am.

Can be viewed here: [listen-this-today.herokuapp.com](https://listen-this-today.herokuapp.com/)

(It's not working properly on live because the free dynos of **Heroku** sleeps while not receiving any web traffic after a 30-minute period.)

<br><br>
Made for joy with Flask, [songs-i-like-api](https://github.com/tugberkozkara/songs-i-like-api) and Spotify API. 

Every day at 12am gets a random song from the songs-i-like-api which provides the songs that I like -obviously :)-
